El dashboard está organizado en cuatro secciones, cada una mejorada por filtros globales que aplican a través de todas las secciones, permitiendo análisis personalizado y granular.\n\n#### Filtros del Dashboard\n\n- **Rango de Fechas**: Selecciona un rango de fechas específico para enfocarse en actividad y gasto de jobs reciente o histórico, permitiendo análisis flexible basado en tiempo a través de costos, operaciones y uso de recursos.\n\n- **Nombre del Workspace**: Filtra por workspace para ver métricas relacionadas con jobs específicas de workspaces individuales, dando a los equipos una vista clara de actividad de jobs e impacto de costos a nivel de workspace.\n\n- **Tipo de Job**: Filtra los datos por tipos específicos de SKU de job (ej., serverless o classic) para analizar variaciones de costo y rendimiento basadas en el tipo de SKU del job.\n\n- **ID de Job y Nombre de Job**: Filtra datos por ID de job o nombre de job para analizar métricas específicas de jobs individuales, permitiendo troubleshooting detallado o revisión de rendimiento de workflows particulares.\n\n- **Nombre del Equipo**: Filtra por equipo para atribuir costos de jobs, uso de recursos e información operacional a equipos específicos, ayudando en responsabilidad y esfuerzos de optimización basados en equipo.\n\n#### Secciones del Dashboard\n\n1. **Desglose de Costos y Análisis de Uso**: Visualizaciones y tablas proporcionando desgloses de costos diarios relacionados con jobs por workspace, SKU, equipo y usuario, junto con información sobre jobs de alto costo. Esta sección ayuda a rastrear patrones de gasto e identificar principales impulsores de costos.\n\n2. **Comparación de Costos y Análisis de Cambios**: Permite comparación de costos sobre marcos de tiempo personalizables, proporcionando información sobre cambios recientes y fluctuaciones de costos a nivel de job para gestión de costos más dirigida.\n\n3. **Análisis Operacional**: Visuales de conteos de ejecuciones de jobs, tiempos de ejecución y tasas de fallo a través de diferentes dimensiones, ofreciendo información sobre eficiencia operacional, tasas de éxito de jobs y patrones en ejecución de jobs a través de equipos y triggers.\n\n4. **Análisis de Clusters**: Métricas de utilización de recursos, incluyendo uso de CPU y memoria, utilización pico por job, y jobs con configuraciones desactualizadas, soportando gestión eficiente de clusters y optimización de configuración.\n\nEn conjunto, estas secciones y filtros proporcionan una vista holística de rendimiento de jobs, costos y utilización de recursos, empoderando a los equipos para tomar decisiones basadas en datos para optimizar configuraciones de jobs, reducir costos operacionales y mejorar el rendimiento general.\n\n#### System Tables Utilizadas\n- system.billing.usage\n- system.billing.list_prices\n- system.lakeflow.jobs\n- system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline\n- system.compute.clusters\n- system.access.table_lineage\n\n"
